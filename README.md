# Elastic SIEM CTF

A Capture The Flag (CTF) environment for Elasticsearch Security that simulates a PowerShell-based enterprise attack scenario. Participants analyze security alerts generated by 4 Elastic prebuilt detection rules to uncover the attack timeline, identify compromised hosts, and understand the attacker's techniques. The CTF includes realistic attack events and background noise to provide a hands-on security investigation experience.
